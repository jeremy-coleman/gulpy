## Installation

Install via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```
$ npm install unique-stream
```

## Examples

### Dedupe a ReadStream based on JSON.stringify:

```ts
import unique from "unique-stream"
import Stream from "stream"

// return a stream of 3 identical objects
function makeStreamOfObjects() {
  const s = new Stream()
  s.readable = true
  let count = 3
  for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    setImmediate(() => {
      s.emit("data", { name: "Bob", number: 123 })
      --count || end()
    })
  }

  function end() {
    s.emit("end")
  }

  return s
}

// Will only print out one object as the rest are dupes. (Uses JSON.stringify)
makeStreamOfObjects().pipe(unique()).on("data", console.log)
```

### Dedupe a ReadStream based on an object property:

```js
// Use name as the key field to dedupe on. Will only print one object
makeStreamOfObjects().pipe(unique("name")).on("data", console.log)
```

### Dedupe a ReadStream based on a custom function:

```js
// Use a custom function to dedupe on. Use the 'number' field. Will only print one object.
makeStreamOfObjects()
  .pipe(data => data.number)
  .on("data", console.log)
```

## Dedupe multiple streams

The reason I wrote this was to dedupe multiple object streams:

```js
const aggregator = unique()

// Stream 1
makeStreamOfObjects().pipe(aggregator)

// Stream 2
makeStreamOfObjects().pipe(aggregator)

// Stream 3
makeStreamOfObjects().pipe(aggregator)

aggregator.on("data", console.log)
```

## Use a custom store to record keys that have been encountered

By default a set is used to store keys encountered so far, in order to check new ones for
uniqueness. You can supply your own store instead, providing it supports the add(key) and
has(key) methods. This could allow you to use a persistent store so that already encountered
objects are not re-streamed when node is reloaded.

```js
const keyStore = {
  store: {},

  add(key) {
    this.store[key] = true
  },

  has(key) {
    return this.store[key] !== undefined
  },
}

makeStreamOfObjects().pipe(unique("name", keyStore)).on("data", console.log)
```
